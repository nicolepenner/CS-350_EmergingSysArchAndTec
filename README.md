# CS-350_EmergingSysArchAndTec

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The goals of this project were to get a temperature sensor to read the temperature of a room, and have an LED on the embedded system light up when the heat is on. The buttons on the embedded system should be able to increase and decrease temperature. This will serve as the base of a project for SysTec to get into the smart thermostat market in the future. The user should be able to set a initial temperature, and eventually turn the heat or air conditioning on to maintain that set point. The board, or eventually the thermostat should alert the user when it is moving toward the set temperature (LED on), and when it has reached it (LED off). As I said, SysTec wants to break into the smart thermostat market and this project is the first step in that process.  

### What did you do particularly well?
I broke apart the pieces of the code to have a piece that performs each function necessary to make this project possible. 

### Where could you improve?

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

###  How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
